# Intro-to-Data-Science
The lectures were hands-on coding sessions where I would take the students through a subject while coding in front of them in a notebook with them testing that same code in real time. I thought it was important for the students to see me code so I could take them through debugging my code if I hit a bug and I could also come to unblock them if it didn't work for them. Those notebooks may be difficult to follow as they assume I was explaining while coding. You will find the lecture notebooks here: https://lnkd.in/gmyGyrUf
- Exploratory data analysis
- Advance Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive statistics
- Statistical inference
- Introduction to probability
- Introduction to machine learning
- Feature selection and Imputation
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep learning (missing for now)
I also had more theoretical notes when the subject was more math involved:https://lnkd.in/gjFPzkht

I spent a lot of time trying to design original hands-on coding Homework: https://lnkd.in/gY4yj63f
- Homework 1: Data manipulation with wikipedia data
- Homework 2: Building a Social network with Wikipedia data
- Homework 3: Statistical study of Particles Diffusion
- Homework 4: Statistical study of the Ising Model
- Homework 5: a Kaggle-like competition with all the students in the class
- Homework 6: Computer vision + Machine Learning

I also had 2 midterms that were actually 2 weeks long open book take-home exams. The material were not taught in class prior and they had to find the resource themselves to learn the subjects. They could work together and I would guide them offline to find the best resources and help them solve the questions. The idea were for the students to solve interview level questions by learning to find the materials online (as we actually do on the job). You can find those 2 Midterms with solutions here: https://lnkd.in/g8WPq-_g. The final was a personal project on any data science subject of their choice.
